      <h2>What is pinkgill?</h2>
      <p>
        Pinkgill is an experimental ATProto site to experiment with a new, more powerful kind of content
        for social media or social-like things. Essentially, it's a way of posting arbitrary interactive
        content that is nevertheless <em>safe</em> (and can be made privacy-friendly, at least if you
        trust your PDS — which you kind of have to, that's the point of a user agent).
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, tiles can declare special kinds of actions that they know how to handle (wishes),
        and these can help them do powerful things — notably generating more tiles. This means that you
        can create new social media formats with just some HTML, CSS, and JS.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're wondering why it's called "pinkgill" when all things AT are either blue or atmospheric,
        it's because several kinds of pinkgill mushrooms are indeed blue, notably the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entoloma_hochstetteri">sky-blue mushroom</a>. And 
        mushrooms are cool.
